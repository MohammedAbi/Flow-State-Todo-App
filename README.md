# Flow State Todo App

This is a Todo application designed to help users manage tasks based on their current flow state and the difficulty of the tasks. The app categorizes tasks into three levels: Green (Easy), Orange (Moderate), and Red (Hard). Tasks are displayed and interacted with based on the user's optimal times for different levels of difficulty.

## Features

- **Add, edit, and delete tasks**
- **Categorize tasks by difficulty (Green, Orange, Red)**
- **Display tasks based on the current time slot**
- **Mark tasks as complete**
- **Progress bar to show completion rate**
- **Responsive design**

## Theory

This app is based on Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow, which emphasizes the importance of being in a state of optimal focus and immersion in tasks. According to the theory, tasks should be matched to the user's skill level and current mental state to maximize productivity and satisfaction.

### Time Slots for Task Availability

- **Red Tasks (Hard)**: Available between 08:00 - 12:00
